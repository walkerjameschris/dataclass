Title: Easily Create Structured Lists or Data Frames with Input Validation
Version: 0.1.10
Authors@R: c(person(
            "Chris", "Walker",
            role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"),
            email = "walkerjameschris@gmail.com"
          ))
Description: Easily define templated lists and data frames with an associated
    validator function for each element. This could be considered a very-minimal
    S7-like standard aimed at validating data frames and lists; two data
    structures the majority of R programmers know well.
