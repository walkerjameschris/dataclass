Title: Easily Create Structured Lists or Data Frames with Input Validation
Version: 0.1.3
Author: Chris Walker
Maintainer: Chris Walker <walkerjameschris@gmail.com>
Description: Easily define templated lists with an associated validator function
    for each element in the list. For example, if you wanted to create a list
    with a min date, max date, and a dataframe, you could use dataclass to
    validate that each of the elements are present and correct. This package
    comes bundled with common validators, however, you can easily define your
    own with an anonymous function. This could be considered a very-minimal
    variant of the S7 standard aimed at standardizing structured data generation
    within an R process. It can also be used to validate data frames (or data
    frame like objects).
